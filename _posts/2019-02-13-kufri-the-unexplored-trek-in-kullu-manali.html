			Being born in the lap of Himalayas, in the Manali Valley, we've seen it - the mountains top, the Beas River gushing through the narrow mountains, the wild &amp; dense forests and so much more. We've climbed almost all the mountain range and trekked the mountain passes such as Rohtang Pass

	We found that the people in village were generally very kind and still seemed to welcome tourists.
	We never felt as though we were walking dollar signs, or that everyone wanted something from us.
	Each person we talked to seemed genuinely interested in our travels and we found the local's to be very easy to befriend .
