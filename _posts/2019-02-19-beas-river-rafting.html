<p>
	As you know, in adventurous activities such as Rafting or Paragliding, the guide must be a professional and certified.
	most of the people negotiate prices with the local companies of Kullu and Manali, who don't have certified guides, and doesn't provide much safety
	precautions or gears. before you book your raft with any local operator do check that they have professional & certified river guide's who can handle
	emergency situation's easily .<br />
	1. do check the rafting gears is all good (life-jacket and helmet).<br />
	2. do check the guide have all gears like (med-kit, throw bag, dry bag, whistle, knife and flipline) .<br />
	3. do wear comfortable clothes .<br />
	4. pay attention to guide instruction follow them with any question's .
